<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This Cuban cocktail is a blend of a few simple ingredients, but the resulting drink is the perfect balance of sweet and tart, not to mention refreshing! What makes this a five-star recipe? It stays true to the original mojito with real, fresh ingredients. The recipe makes one serving, but you can easily scale it up to make a pitcher for summertime entertaining. </p>
<p>As with most cocktails, crafting mojitos requires a few special tools â€” namely, a muddler. This bartending tool is used to crush fresh herbs and fruits to help release their flavors. If you don't have a muddler, use the end of a wooden spoon instead. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
    <li>1/2 medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup ice cubes, or as needed</li>
    <li>1/2 fluid ounces white rum</li>
    <li>1/2 cup club soda, or as needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler and crush to release mint oils and lime juice.</li>
    <li>Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</li>
    <li>Fill the glass almost to the top with ice. Pour in rum and fill the glass with club soda.</li>
    <li>Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Tips</h4>
<p>Tonic water can be used instead of club soda but the taste will be different and somewhat bitter.</p>
